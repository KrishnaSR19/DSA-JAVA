/*
 * Q.Given two integers start and goal. Flip the minimum number of bits of start integer to convert it into goal integer.
A bits flip in the number val is to choose any bit in binary representation of val and flipping it from either 0 to 1 or 1 to 0.
 */

/*
 * Time Complexity: O(1)
The XOR operation between two integers is performed in constant time, O(1).
The for loop iterates over a fixed number of bits (32 bits for a standard integer), which is as good as O(1).
Space Complexity: O(1) â€“ Using a couple of variables i.e., constant space.
